# Domain Phishing Detection with Deep Learning

üõ°Ô∏è An AI-powered cybersecurity solution for detecting phishing URLs using Convolutional Neural Networks and LSTM architectures.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project implements advanced deep learning techniques to identify malicious phishing URLs through character-level analysis. By treating URLs as sequences of characters, our CNN-LSTM hybrid model achieves **98.77% accuracy** in distinguishing between legitimate and phishing websites.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Character-Level Analysis**: Advanced tokenization of URLs up to 256 characters
- **Hybrid CNN-LSTM Architecture**: Combines pattern detection with sequential modeling
- **High Performance**: Achieves 98.77% accuracy with 95.48% precision
- **Real-time Detection**: Optimized for fast URL classification
- **Comprehensive Pipeline**: Complete data preprocessing to model deployment

## üìä Dataset

- **Primary Dataset**: 549,346 labeled URLs (phishing vs legitimate)
- **Preprocessing**: Character-level tokenization with one-hot encoding
- **Feature Engineering**: Domain analysis, SSL status, character frequency
- **Data Shape**: 3D tensors (samples, 68, 256) for neural network input

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Model Components
- **Embedding Layer**: Maps characters to dense vectors (68 dimensions)
- **2D Convolutional Layer**: Detects local patterns in URL structure
- **MaxPooling Layer**: Reduces dimensionality while preserving features
- **LSTM Layer**: Captures sequential dependencies
- **Dense Output**: Binary classification with sigmoid activation

### Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: 98.77%
- **Precision**: 95.48%
- **Recall**: 98.45%
- **Model Parameters**: ~1.2M trainable parameters
